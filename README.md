Nhl-stats-frontend
==================

Frontend for keeping score of sports games' results (for example NHL-games) between friends and foes and versus online.  

Uses web workers and async to easen the effect on mobile devices of calculating the stats when a lot of games have been played. 

Note! Requires back-end: backend will receive POSTs of match results and give (GET) a list of all games played in required form. I'll post a express+mongodb backend a bit later.  

Example with static backend:
